            <ul>
              <li><span>Handle with Card: </span>Avoid rough handling or dropping your jewelry, as this can cause damage or scratches, especially to delicate gemstones or settings.</li>
              <li><span>Store Properly: </span>When not in use, store your jewelry in a clean, dry place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Consider using individual pouches or compartments to prevent pieces from scratching or tangling.</li>
              <li><span>Separate Pieces: </span>Store each piece of jewelry separately to prevent them from scratching or tangling with other pieces. This is especially important for delicate items such as necklaces and earrings.</li>

            <h2>Cleaning and Maintenance</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Regular Cleaning: </span>Clean your jewelry regularly to remove dirt, oils, and other residues that can dull its appearance. Use a soft, lint-free cloth to gently wipe the surface of each piece after wearing.</li>
              <li><span>Mild Soap and Water: </span>For more thorough cleaning, use a mild soap and lukewarm water solution. Soak your jewelry for a few minutes, then gently scrub with a soft brush, such as a toothbrush, to remove dirt and grime. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry with a clean cloth.</li>
              <li><span>Avoid Harsh Chemicals: </span>Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners on your jewelry, as they can damage gemstones and metal finishes. This includes household cleaners, bleach, and ammonia-based products.</li>
              <li><span>Gemstone-Specific Care:</span>Different gemstones may require specific care techniques. Refer to our Gemstone Care Guide or consult with a professional jeweler for guidance on cleaning and maintaining specific gemstone jewelry.</li>

              <li><span>Avoid Exposure: </span>Avoid exposing your jewelry to harsh chemicals, such as chlorine or perfume, as they can tarnish metal finishes and damage gemstones. Remove jewelry before swimming, bathing, or engaging in activities that may expose it to chemicals or abrasives.</li>
              <li><span>Professional Inspection: </span>Periodically have your jewelry inspected by a professional jeweler to check for loose stones, worn prongs, or other signs of damage. Prompt repairs can prevent further damage and prolong the life of your jewelry.</li>
              <li><span>Avoid Extreme Conditions: </span>Avoid exposing your jewelry to extreme temperatures or sudden temperature changes, as these can cause damage to certain gemstones and metals. Remove jewelry before engaging in activities such as gardening or exercising to prevent damage.</li>
